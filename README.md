The main purpose of this project is to run 6 different methods and comparing them to see which one reached the best prediction

1. Linear Regression
2. K Neighbors Regressor
3. Gradient Boosting Regressor
4. AdaBoost Regressor
5. Random Forest Regressor
6. SVR

Conclusion: The random forest regressor has the best result compared to others models. Details included in the notebook.
